## Speech To Text
This project is an efficient Speech to Text API using Whisper which serves the purpose of speech recognition model. 
It takes as input an audio input and converts it into readable text.

This project has many real life use cases such us in calling centers: where the phonecalls could be transformed into text and then apply on the text a sentiment analysis classifier  and so on.
